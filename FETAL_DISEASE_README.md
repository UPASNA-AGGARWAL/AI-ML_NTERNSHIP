Fetal Disease Classification Project
Overview
The Fetal Disease Classification project is designed for the classification of fetal health conditions using machine learning techniques. This project utilizes popular classification algorithms, namely k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Naive Bayes, and Random Forest, to provide accurate predictions for fetal disease categories.

Confusion Matrix Visualization
To visually assess the performance of the classification models, a confusion matrix is generated and displayed using Matplotlib. The code snippet below demonstrates this visualization:

python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming 'ax' is the axis object and 'cm' is the confusion matrix
plt.setp(ax.get_xticklabels(), rotation=45, ha="right", rotation_mode="anchor")
for i in range(cm.shape[0]):
    for j in range(cm.shape[1]):
        ax.text(j, i, format(cm[i, j], "d"), ha="center", va="center", color="white" if cm[i, j] > cm.max() / 2 else "black")

fig.tight_layout()
plt.show()
This visual representation aids in understanding the model's performance and identifying areas of improvement.

Classification Models
1. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
python
Copy code
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

knn_model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)
knn_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
knn_predictions = knn_model.predict(X_test)
knn_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, knn_predictions)

print("k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Accuracy:", knn_accuracy)
2. Naive Bayes
python
Copy code
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB

nb_model = GaussianNB()
nb_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
nb_predictions = nb_model.predict(X_test)
nb_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, nb_predictions)

print("Naive Bayes Accuracy:", nb_accuracy)
3. Random Forest
python
Copy code
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

rf_model = RandomForestClassifier()
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
rf_predictions = rf_model.predict(X_test)
rf_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, rf_predictions)

print("Random Forest Accuracy:", rf_accuracy)
These models are trained on the provided dataset to classify fetal health conditions accurately.
